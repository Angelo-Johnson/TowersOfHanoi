1. Prerequisites:
        To run the game, youâ€™ll need a modern web browser like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Safari.

2. Download or Clone the Repository:
        If you're running the game locally, download or clone the repository that includes the following files:

        =index.html
        =style.css
        =script.js

3. Running the Application:
        Simply open the index.html file in your browser by double-clicking on it, which will launch the game in the browser.

4. Playing the Game:
        Once the game is loaded, you can select the number of disks you want to play with.

        Click "Start Game" to begin.

        Drag the disks between rods to solve the puzzle, ensuring that larger disks are placed below smaller ones.

        You can pause the game with the "Pause" button or restart it using the "Restart" button.

        After completing the puzzle and moving all disks to the final rod, the game will display your time and move count. 
        If your time is the fastest for that number of disks, it will update the leaderboard.

5. Leaderboard:
        The leaderboard shows the fastest times for each disk count. 
        The data is stored in your browser's local storage, so it will remain even if you close or refresh the page.
